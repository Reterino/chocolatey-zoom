Additionally, LMI may assign all or any part of the performance of this Agreement to an Affiliate Entity without Your prior written consent.

Rescue+MobileTM, allow You to remotely access and/or remotely control a computer, server or other device; remotely monitor and manage certain cloud applications; and/or remotely transfer files from one device to another.  By clicking through these Terms, using any of these Services or otherwise indicating Your acceptance of these Terms, You hereby agree that You will not (i) use any of our remote access, management and support Services to attempt to gain unauthorized access to computer systems or devices that you do not have permission to access or otherwise interfere with another User's use and enjoyment of our Services or other cloud applications; (ii) use the Services to distribute or transmit any software or other computer files that contain a virus, Trojan horse, worm or other harmful or destructive component;  (iii) use the Services under false pretenses to gain access to a third party?s PII, computer systems or other devices or applications; or (iv) use the Services for any other illegal or unauthorized purposes.  You agree that You are responsible for the actions and inactions of Your employees and consultants and will use commercially reasonable efforts to monitor Your employees and consultants. LMI reserves the right to disable Your account or take any other action that LMI in its sole discretion deems necessary or appropriate, including pursuing legal action, in the event that LMI has reason to believe that You have violated the terms of this Section.
6.2.	SMS Messaging. If You are licensing Rescue+Mobile pursuant to these Terms, You are entitled to a combined maximum of one hundred (100) SMS text messages per seat, per month. If You exceed this combined maximum amount per seat, per month, You agree to negotiate in good faith with LMI a commercially reasonable rate per text message over one hundred (100) per seat, per month.

Article VII.  Additional Terms for Collaboration Services
7.1.	Using LMI?s Collaboration Services. LMI?s Collaboration Services, CubbyTM and join.me?, allow You to host online meetings, share Your screen and files with other users and sync and store Your files in the cloud and/or across multiple devices so that they can easily be shared with others.  By clicking through these Terms, using any of these Collaboration Services or otherwise indicating Your acceptance of these Terms, You hereby agree that You will not (i) use the Services to share, store or transmit any unlawful, harassing, libelous, defamatory, racist, indecent, abusive, violent, threatening, intimidating, harmful, vulgar, obscene, offensive or otherwise objectionable material of any kind or nature; or (ii) use the Services to share copyrighted material that You do not own or have permission to share or distribute.
7.2.	Collaboration Disclaimer. LMI is not responsible for the images/sounds/etc. you may view or experience while viewing another party?s screen, folders, files, etc.  LMI has no obligation to monitor any information stored on or shared through the Services and is not responsible for the accuracy, appropriateness or legality of any files, posts, links or other information You may be able to share or access while using the Services.
7.3.	Use of the join.me Conference Line.  The join.me conference line is licensed by LMI from a third-party telecommunications provider that grants You access to the conference line directly.  For the avoidance of doubt, LMI is not itself a telecommunications provider and does not itself provide any telecommunications-related services.  If You are licensing join.me pursuant to these Terms, the join.me conference line is free to use, but it is not a toll-free number. While LMI does not charge You for the use of the conference line, applicable roaming, data and other operator or carrier charges/fees may apply.  You understand and agree that You are solely responsible for paying for any such charges/fees.  International dial-in numbers are only active on calls hosted by a pro subscriber.
7.4.  Recording Disclosure.  Customer understands that use of join.me?s conference recording feature may subject Customer to laws or regulations regarding the recording of telephone calls and other electronic communications, and that it is thus Customer?s responsibility to properly notify all participants in a recorded join.me meeting that the meeting is being recorded.  LMI will not be held liable for Customer?s failure to do so.  Although features may exist in the Service to alert participants that a meeting is being recorded, such notice may not be relied upon as definitive disclosure for Customer?s compliance with applicable laws.
7.5.	Sharing Your Cubby. The Cubby Service permits You to share Your Cubby with others or make Your Cubby public. You shall retain full ownership of the files that You store within Your Cubby and these Terms do not grant LMI any title, ownership or intellectual property rights to any of Your files, except for the limited rights that are required to provide the Service to You.  However, You should carefully consider what You choose to share with other users as LMI has no responsibility for any files that You share with others. You agree not to use Cubby to share any files that You do not have the legal right to share with others. You understand and agree that purchasing or otherwise legally obtaining documents, videos, music, software or other forms of media does not necessarily grant You the right to distribute or publicly share those files with third parties through the Service. By sharing Your Cubby with other users, You are representing that You either (i) own all copyrights in the files You have placed in Your Cubby or (ii) have obtained permission from the rightful copyright holder to share such files.
